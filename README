fwlog version 1.3
==================

fwlog.pm helps to parse firewall log data and extract the following information.
	- action (accept/drop/etc)
	- source (source IP address or hostname)
	- destination (destination IP address or hostname)
	- protocol (IP protocol number or name such as TCP/UDP/ICMP/50/etc)
	- service (port or service name or number such as http/80/etc)

This Perl module aims to reduce the effort required to parse the multitude of
different firewall log formats.  Due to the large number of firewalls and log formats
this module cannot cover every type and version of firewall.  If you have logs which 
are not supported, please feel free to send me some sample logs, with obfuscated IP's 
if you wish.

For more information please see the POD included in the module using

	perldoc fwlog
